# Phala x amsterDOT Hackathon 2022

![](assets/Logo-bg.svg)

On this page, you will find everything you need to participant in the Phala bounties in the amsterDOT Hackathon event.

Phala Network is a Kusama/Polakdot parachain focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on Secure Enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala Fat Contracts can:

- **be privacy-preserving**: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract;
- **interact with HTTP services**: you can build an Oracle or Telegram bot as a Fat Contract;
- **run computation extensive code**: you can build games and analytics jobs in Fat Contracts without block latency.

## üìÖ Dates

- Start hack: 21 April
- Duration: 6 weeks
- End of hack: 02 June
- Announcement of winners: TBA

## üèÅ Phala Bounties

### Beginners

Follow the Fat Contract Tutorial to complete the challenge. You can get 100 PHA prize for finished challenge. The first 50 successful submissions are eligible for the prize.

| Challenge | Winners  |
| --------- | -------- |
| 100 PHA   | First 50 |

**Challenge**: In the beginner challenges, we have prepared the tutorials to write and deploy your first Fat Contract to Phala Testnet, and use our frontend SDK to interact with your contract in a secure way.

For the challenge details and how to submit, please refer to:

- [Beginner Challenge sub-page](#TODO)


### Advanced

Build a fully functional DApp with Fat Contract on Phala Testnet.

We don't limit the scope or type of the DApp. When the hackathon is finished, the Phala team will judge the submission and pick up the winners of prizes:

| 1st | 2nd | 3rd | plus |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| TBA | TBA | TBA | TBA  |

A qualified DApp should be _useful_ to solve some real-world problems or bring fun to people. It should also utilize the unique features of Phala (privacy-preserving, computation-intensive, or with HTTP requests)
