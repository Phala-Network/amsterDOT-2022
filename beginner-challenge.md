# Phala x amsterDOT Hackathon 2022

![](assets/Logo-bg.svg)

On this page, you will find everything you need to participant in the Phala bounties in the amsterDOT Hackathon event.

Phala Network is a Kusama/Polakdot parachain focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on Secure Enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala Fat Contracts can:

- **be privacy-preserving**: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract;
- **interact with HTTP services**: you can build an Oracle or Telegram bot as a Fat Contract;
- **run computation extensive code**: you can build games and analytics jobs in Fat Contracts without block latency.

To learn more about what you can build on Phala, please read the challenge ideas, refer to our [documentation](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/developer/fat-contract-tutorial/).

## üßë‚Äçüíª [Beginner Challenge] Link your Github account to on-chain identity with HTTP Request

### Challenge description

In this challenge, you will experience how to use Fat Contract's HTTP request capability to associate a Phala account with a Github user. Such functionality serves as the core for [Decentralized Identity (DID)](https://www.gsma.com/identity/decentralised-identity). Further, we will show how to deploy your contract in [Phala Testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpoc5.phala.network%2Fws#/explorer) and interact with it through our [frontend SDK](https://github.com/Phala-Network/js-sdk).

The Fat Contract "Redeem POAP" links on-chain accounts to Github accounts and then distributes POAP redeem code to the verified users. The simple protocol is listed below:

1. The user should create a Github Gist with a special format with the account id: "This gist is owned by address: 0x01234...."
2. The user submits the raw file URL to the Fat Contract by a _query_ ("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/[username]/[gist-id]/raw/...")
3. The contract then
    - Verifies the URL is valid
    - Fetches the content of the URL (by Fat Contract's HTTP in Query feature)
    - Verifies the account claim in the gist is valid
    - Extracts the Github username from the URL and the account id from the claim
    - Produces an `Attestation` struct with the Github username and the account id, and signs it with a contract-owned key (by Fat Contract's confidentiality and cryptographic feature)
4. The user receives the `SignedAttestation`, and then submit the attestation to the contract by a `redeem` _command_
5. The contract verifies the attestation, and then links the Github username and the account id
6. If the user didn't claim any POAP, it reveals a POAP code to the user after the verification

By the end of this task, you will be able to:

- Write your first Fat Contract and deploy it to our Testnet;
- Use provided contract frontend to interact with your contract in a secure way.

Follow our [Tutorial](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/developer/fat-contract-tutorial/) for detailed instructions.

## Submission requirements
