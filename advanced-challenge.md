# Phala x amsterDOT Hackathon 2022

![](assets/Logo-bg.svg)

On this page, you will find everything you need to participant in the Phala bounties in the amsterDOT Hackathon event.

Phala Network is a Kusama/Polakdot parachain focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on Secure Enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala Fat Contracts can:

- **be privacy-preserving**: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract;
- **interact with HTTP services**: you can build an Oracle or Telegram bot as a Fat Contract;
- **run computation extensive code**: you can build games and analytics jobs in Fat Contracts without block latency.

To learn more about what you can build on Phala, please read the challenge ideas, refer to our [documentation](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/developer/fat-contract-tutorial/).

## üßë‚Äçüíª [Advanced Challenge] Build Your Own DApp

### Challenge description

In this challenge, you are going to build a fully functional DApp on Phala Confidential Cloud.

A qualified DApp should be useful to solve some real-world problems or bring fun to people. It should also address the unique features of Phala (privacy-preserving, CPU extensive, or with HTTP requests)

While we really have some ideas for reference:
- One important features of Fat Contract is its low-latency and the scale underlying computing power, making it a good replacement as Metaverse/game backend and other compute-intensive tasks which now can only be executed on centralized cloud services;
- Another feature is the HTTP request ability. Compared with existing Oracle which can only introduce Web2 data to Web3 world, Fat Contract is able to affect the Web2 with their HTTP APIs. This facilitates applications like decentralized [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore/new_to_ifttt) that connects multiple Web2 and Web3 services.

Also, you can refer to the [Advanced Submissions](https://github.com/Phala-Network/Encode-Hackathon-2021/issues/21) in our previous hackathon.

Suggested Ideas include:

- File encryption middleware (for NFT assets on decentralized storage or HTTP servers, etc)
- Privacy enhanced Defi
- Social media: twitter-like feed, forum, blog, IM chat
- Games
- Website backend

If your idea requires features which is not yet provided by Fat Contract, try contacting us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/zQKNGv4) to see how it can be improved.

## Submission requirements

1. Create a standalone repository for your backend contract, fork [JS SDK repo](https://github.com/Phala-Network/js-sdk) and make necessary changes in a new branch of your forked repo
2. Submit a brief introduction to the usage of your DApp
3. Take a screenshot of your frontend to show your unique feature
4. Send the screenshots and share your feeling on Twitter
5. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zQKNGv4) and submit the link to your tweet in the **#amsterdot-hack-submission** chat room.

**Submit the challenge at this repo:** You need to submit the work to this repo as a Github Issue after you have finished the above steps. Please create an issue in this repository with the following information:

- Title: **"Advanced Challenge Submission"**
- Content:
    - Links to your repos
    - A brief introduction of your DApp
    - The Twitter link
    - Your Discord handler (will contact you for prizes)

When the hackathon is finished, the Phala team will judge the submission and pick up the winners of prizes.
